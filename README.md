# Project Title :
PowerBi-IT-Mapping-Dashboard.

## Project Overview :
This project is focusing on the second mapping of the IT industry in North Macedonia. 
All of this data is provided to us for use through the Brainster Data Science Academy by Data Masters.
The survey was conducted from June 15th to July 11th, involving more than 2,000 local IT professionals (specifically 2,237, with 2,047 valid responses).

## Project Highlights :
- **Survey Methodology:** The research is based on a survey with 2,237 participants, encompassing IT professionals from the country.
  All responses are anonymous, with data entry limited to once per participant. Out of the responses, 2,047 were qualified as valid (1,785 Programming/Dev/System Administration + 138 Marketing + 124 Design + 190 invalid).

- **Data Processing Approach:**
  - Incomes less than 10,000 MKD and greater than 800,000 MKD were excluded from monthly net income calculations.
  The median was used instead of the mean in income calculations due to variations in the data.
  - Participants working abroad were excluded from monthly net income calculations.
  - Similar job positions were grouped for analysis, such as full-stack, back-end, and front-end developers falling under the Software Developer category.

- **Survey Outreach:** The survey was distributed through various channels, including IT.mk texts,
  IT forums, organic and paid placements on social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter), and direct emails to relevant IT companies and associations.
